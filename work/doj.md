_Front-End Web Development | Drupal Theming & Development_

As a subcontractor, I worked with a small team to develop and maintain the new FBI Jobs website. My role on the project was to oversee the front-end development of the site, communicate technical blockers and challenges to the project managers and dev operations, work closely with dev operations to implement CI/CD pipeline and modern workflows and interview potential candidates for developer roles on the project.
