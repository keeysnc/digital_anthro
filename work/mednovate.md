### [View Project](https://www.mednovateconnect.com)

**[Mednovate ConnectÂ®](https://www.mednovateconnect.com)** is a medication management provider and pioneer of telehealth in the Washington, DC Metro Area.

Mednovate Connect reached out to Digital Anthro in need of a website refresh, UI/UX consulting and potential platform migration. After defining the reason for the website refresh we began user research and formed a strategy to create a more directed experience for users. To align with the clients goals we decided on a platform migration from Wordpress to Squarespace to help with easing the content editing learning curve. Mednovate Connect's website launched back in March with positive responses from their team.
