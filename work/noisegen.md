_WebGL | Three.js Development_

##### Overview

Noisegen is an award-winning experimental 3D Perlin Noise generator that saves and exports your art. This was a self initiated project to learn the workings of three.js, webGL and shader noise. Working on this project taught me alot about how to set up a 3D enviornment in the browser and manipulate parameters with a custom GUI. I submmited the site to awwwards.com and was awarded honorable mention and mobile excellence.
