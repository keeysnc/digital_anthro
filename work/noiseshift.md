Noise Shift is a generative art piece created using the Javascript programming language. The art consists of a 3D object which is manipulated by the input of a Perlin Noise algorithm. The scene which holds the object loops indefinitely while generating a new shape for every loop. This concept derived from the Deconstruction "school of thought" by Jacques Derrida. The idea that interpretation is dependent on context sparked the inspiration to create a piece that visually symbolizes different perspectives on a sole object. The perception of context changes based on experience, similar to the rotating 3d object which adapts based on the algorithmic input.
